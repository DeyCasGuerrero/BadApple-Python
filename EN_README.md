# SCRIPT

## INTRODUCTION
This is a script to display the Bad Apple video in ASCII art, a well-known meme that can be played anywhere, with or without a screen.

# We only need to install Pillow, pywhatkit, and pygame.
1) pip install Pillow (this allows us to interact with images)
2) pip install pywhatkit (allows us to convert images to ASCII)
3) pip install pygame (allows us to play mp3 files)

# IMPORTANT
You should run the code from the file to generate a .txt file and display the video with ASCII art (you can also view it from the terminal).
